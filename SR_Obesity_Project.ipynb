    "More specifically, *\"features\"*, in a Social Research environment, are attributes or variables that are considered and analyzed to better understand social phenomena, relationships, and human behavior. Also, when a variable is *\"continuous\"* it means that it is a characteristic or attribute that can take on an infinite number of values within a specified range. These variables are measurable on a continuous scale and are not restricted to discrete or categorical values. In fact, when features are *\"categorical\"*, it signifies that they correspond variables that take discrete values and can be organized into distinct categories or levels rather than on a continuous scale. These categories can be represented by labels or nominal values that do not imply intrinsic ordering. Again, when features are *\"binary\"*, it indicates that they exemplify variables that take only two distinct values or categories. These two categories can be delineated by labels such as \"0\" and \"1,\" \"yes\" and \"no,\" \"present\" and \"absent,\" \"male\" and \"female,\" \"success\" and \"failure,\" and so on. Finally, when features are of type *\"integer\"* it denotes that they represent numeric variables that take only integer values, that is, numbers without fractions or decimals. These variables are typically measurable on an integer scale and cannot take non - integer values."
